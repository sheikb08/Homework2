# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

For this project I used Bootstrap's internal logic to engineer various  sections within portfolio page. 

# Index Page

* I created and formatted a navigational bar using BootStrap
* I used the Grid method to format my Rock, Paper, Scissors project and my Refactoring Project
* Both Projects on this page can be accessed by clicking its image.

# About Page

* I used CSS to creage a header and box that was used to host my bio. I also used the bootstrapped responsive image tag to input my picture
* Added the link to my business's webpage.

# Contact Page

* I used bootstrap to create a form that will allow the user to input First Name, Last Name, E-mail Address and Input a message. However, this form is not linked to a server so no infor is actually captured.
* Added a submit button that does work
* Used CSS to create form background color and border
